# ProjectLP
Converts Beatsaber To be played on a novation launchpad MK2, Mini, X.

Uses these resources: 
https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/map-format.html
https://github.com/FMMT666/launchpad.py
https://pygame-menu.readthedocs.io/en/4.0.0/

#### To run (TODO - now you just follow the "To work on code" section and run the python file)
* Download zip
* unzip to anywhere
* run ProjectLP.exe
* If you're only interested in running the program, you should only need the Song folder and the .exe

### To work on code:
* Clone repo (to a new branch)
* pip install -r requiredpackages.txt

### To add your own song:
* download beatsaber file from beastsaber: https://bsaber.com/
* unzip the file in a subdirectory and place it in the Songs folder (eg. Songs/mysong/beatmap-files-here). Do not extract the archive directly in the Songs folder. The subfolder must not have spaces in its name.

#### Notes
USB cable for launchpads arent very good, if something breaks first stop program and unplug/replug both ends of the cable
